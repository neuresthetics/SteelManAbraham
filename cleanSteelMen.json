It's used in engineering, business, and innovation to achieve breakthroughs by avoiding conventional wisdom and focusing on what is physically or logically possible. Musk has applied this at SpaceX (e.g., rethinking rocket costs from raw materials), Tesla (e.g., battery design from atomic levels), and xAI (e.g., training AI to derive answers independently).",
