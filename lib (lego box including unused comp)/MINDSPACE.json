      "content": "Influencing people's behaviour is nothing new to Government, which has often used tools such as legislation, regulation or taxation to achieve desired policy outcomes. But many of the biggest policy challenges we are now facing – such as the increase in people with chronic health conditions – will only be resolved if we are successful in persuading people to change their behaviour, their lifestyles or their existing habits. Fortunately, over the last decade, our understanding of influences on behaviour has increased significantly and this points the way to new approaches and new solutions. So whilst behavioural theory has already been deployed to good effect in some areas, it has much greater potential to help us. To realise that potential, we have to build our capacity and ensure that we have a sophisticated understanding of what does influence behaviour. This report is an important step in that direction because it shows how behavioural theory could help achieve better outcomes for citizens, either by complementing more established policy tools, or by suggesting more innovative interventions. In doing so, it draws on the most recent academic evidence, as well as exploring the wide range of existing good work in applying behavioural theory across the public sector. Finally, it shows how these insights could be put to practical use. This report tackles complex issues on which there are wide-ranging public views. We hope it will help stimulate debate amongst policy-makers and stakeholders and help us build our capability to use behaviour theory in an appropriate and effective way."

    "about_this_report": {
      "content": "In 2009, Sir Gus O’Donnell, Cabinet Secretary and Head of the Home Civil Service, asked Matt Tee, Permanent Secretary for Government Communication, to review the implications of behavioural theory for policy-making. The Cabinet Office commissioned the Institute for Government to produce this report, exploring the application of behavioural theory to public policy for senior public sector leaders and policy-makers. It is a key part of a programme of work designed to build capacity and capability in this area across the Civil Service. We have approached the topic collaboratively. The programme began with a behaviour change summit in May 2009, which brought together senior policy, strategy and insight officials from across government, alongside a number of external experts. We approached the report by first developing an understanding of how and where behavioural theory is currently being used in public services, and the challenges it presents. The report is grounded in a series of interviews with senior civil servants, academics and behaviour change experts but the views expressed in the report are those of the authors and Institute for Government. Our thanks go to the many people we interviewed as part of our research. We would also like to thank Dr Robert Metcalfe for his work analysing the effects that underpin MINDSPACE. This is the full version of the report. Those looking for a summary of the main practical applications may wish to consult the Short Version, also available at www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk."

This is an important idea at any time, but is especially relevant in a period of fiscal constraint.",

        "rationale": [
          "The vast majority of public policy aims to change or shape our behaviour. And policy-makers have many ways of doing so. Most obviously, they can use “hard” instruments such as legislation and regulation to compel us to act in certain ways. These approaches are often very effective, but are costly and inappropriate in many instances. So government often turns to less coercive, and sometimes very effective, measures, such as incentives (e.g. excise duty) and information provision (e.g. public health guidance) – as well as sophisticated communications techniques.",
          "Why, then, is there a need to change anything? Behavioural theory suggests two reasons. First, the impact of existing tools such as incentives and information can be greatly enhanced by new evidence about how our behaviour is influenced (some of which has already been incorporated into government communications). Second, there are new, and potentially more effective, ways government could shape behaviour.",
          "Tools such as incentives and information are intended to change behaviour by “changing minds”. If we provide the carrots and sticks, alongside accurate information, people will weigh up the revised costs and benefits of their actions and respond accordingly. Unfortunately, evidence suggests that people do not always respond in this ‘perfectly rational’ way.",
          "In contrast, approaches based on “changing contexts” - the environment within which we make decisions and respond to cues - have the potential to bring about significant changes in behaviour at relatively low cost. Shaping policy more closely around our inbuilt responses to the world offers a potentially powerful way to improve individual wellbeing and social welfare."

Emphasizes MINDSPACE as tools enhancing existing methods without replacement. The principle illustrated is MINDSPACE as behaviour-change tools within practical 6 Es (Explore, Enable, Encourage, Engage, Exemplify, Evaluate) framework for policy-making.",
        "integration": "Applying MINDSPACE in practice builds on existing methods of policy-making. To illustrate this, we have drawn on the “4Es” policy framework, originally developed by DEFRA. The 4Es are four actions that should underpin government’s attempts to change behaviour: Enable, Encourage, Engage and Exemplify. MINDSPACE requires two supporting actions: Explore, which takes place before policies are implemented, and Evaluate, which judges the success of the policy. In basic terms, MINDSPACE represents the tools for changing behaviour, and the 6 Es constitute the framework within which they can be applied. Bringing them together allows policy-makers to address the over-arching “so what?” question in practical ways. But when applying MINDSPACE in practice, it should not simply be seen as an alternative to existing methods. “Behaviour Change” is part of policy-making, rather than a novel alternative that can be bolted onto policies. Therefore, civil servants need to better understand the behavioural dimension of their policies and actions. MINDSPACE can help them do so in three different ways:",
        "applications": {
          "Enhance": "MINDSPACE can help policy-makers understand how current attempts to change behaviour could be improved, for example through a better understanding of how people respond to incentives and which types of information are salient. The logic here is that if government is already attempting to shape behaviour, it should do so as effectively as possible.",
          "Introduce": "Some of the elements in MINDSPACE are not used extensively by policy-makers, yet may have a considerable impact. For example, there is room for more innovative use of social norms and commitment devices in policies. Of course, introducing new measures in this way may require significant efforts to ensure there is public permission for the approach.",
          "Reassess": "Government needs to understand the ways it may be changing the behaviour of citizens unintentionally. It is quite possible that government produces unintended – and possibly unwanted – changes in behaviour. The insights from MINDSPACE offer a rigorous way of analysing whether and how government is shaping the behaviour of its citizens."

      "public_permission_and_responsibility": {
        "permission": "The use of MINDSPACE (or other ‘nudge’ type policy tools) may require careful handling – in essence, the public need to give permission and help shape how such tools are used. With this in mind, we consider issues around gaining democratic permission for behaviour change policies. We explain how three factors are particularly useful for understanding controversy around behaviour change: who the policy affects; what type of behaviour is intended; how the change will be accomplished.",
        "responsibility": "Behaviour change is often seen as government intruding into issues that should be the domain of personal responsibility. However, it is possible for government just to supply the trigger or support for individuals to take greater personal responsibility. And we suggest that evidence from behavioural theory may, in some areas, challenge accepted notions of personal responsibility."
      },
      "conclusion": {
        "benefits": "New insights from the science of behaviour change could lead to significantly improved policy outcomes, and at lower cost, than the way many conventional policy tools are currently used. For the most part, however, MINDSPACE powerfully complements and improves conventional policy tools, rather than acting as a replacement for them. MINDSPACE may also help identify any barriers that are currently preventing changes in behaviour.",
        "uncertainties": "But there is still much that we do not know. There remains uncertainty over how lasting many of the effects are; how effects that work in one set of circumstances will work in another; and whether effects that work well with one segment of the population will work with another, including their potential impact on inequalities – though there are grounds to think that going with the grain will help to reduce them.",
        "roles": "There are also questions about how far such techniques should be employed by central government or left to local policymakers, professionals and communities. One of the most important roles for central government in the coming years will be to ensure that local and professional applications of behavioural approaches are rigorously evaluated, and the results made available for communities to debate and adopt as they see fit. When the cost-effectiveness for an application is clearly shown, and the public acceptability has been established, central government might then move to national implementation – be this to reduce crime, strengthen communities, or support healthy and prosperous lives.",
        "overall": "Whether reluctantly or enthusiastically, today’s policymakers are in the business of influencing behaviour, and therefore need to understand the various effects on behaviour their policies may be having. MINDSPACE helps them do so, and therefore has the potential to achieve better outcomes for individuals and society."
