## Criteria
The evaluation of steel man arguments adheres to neutral, predefined standards rooted in Spinoza's geometric method: clarity of definitions (precision rule), self-evidence of axioms (deductive reasoning rule), logical necessity in propositions (impersonality rule), and holistic coherence (system-building rule). Alignment with Ethics prioritizes reason over passions, conatus enhancement, and freedom from biases (therapeutic aspect). Lucifer Principle integration assesses realism in aggression/hierarchies without endorsement (critique rule). Fallacy avoidance ensures no suppressed evidence, ipse dixit, or appeals to emotion/authority (forbidden fallacies). Sources balanced via equal pro/anti queries (e.g., 15 each), emphasizing 2023-2025 data for currency. Ratings quantitative: geometric (0-60), Ethics (0-40), Lucifer (0-40, negative if overreliant), fallacy (0-20, deducted per detection); total /100. Higher scores reflect deductive rigor, ethical utility, balanced realism, and logical purity.

## ReturnSteelMen
**Steel Man A: Infant Circumcision as Ethical Violation and Violence Perpetuator**  
Infant circumcision constitutes nonconsensual bodily violation, imprinting trauma that disrupts attachment and fosters aggression, per 2025 PMC studies linking neonatal pain to altered socio-affective processing (e.g., lower emotional stability, higher stress). Definitions: Violation as privation of integrity without consent; Trauma as cortisol-spiked stress yielding inadequate ideas (Ethics III Prop 35). Axioms: Causes necessitate effects (Ethics I A3); passions from harm hinder virtue (IV P3). Propositions: Prop 1—Elevated UTIs/STIs in uncircumcised manageable via hygiene, but nonconsent invalidates (V P6, necessity understanding empowers). Prop 2—Psychological harm evident in 2025 ResearchGate correlations with ASD/ADHD, aggression via ACE scores. Prop 3—Cycles perpetuated culturally, normalizing harm in superorganisms (Lucifer Prop 4). Falsifiable: No elevated markers in circumcised cohorts negates.

**Steel Man B: Infant Circumcision as Rational Health and Ethical Covenant**  
Infant circumcision, with anesthesia, yields proven benefits like 90% UTI reduction, 50-60% lower HIV/HPV (2025 WHO meta-analysis), and minimal 0.2-0.6% complications, aligning with conatus via preventive utility (Ethics IV P38). Definitions: Benefit as power increase; Covenant as reasoned harmony (II P7, ideas parallel things). Axioms: Useful dispositions good (IV P38); necessity dictates actions (I P29). Propositions: Prop 1—2025 NEJM meta-analysis shows no long-term psych harm, equivalent sexual function. Prop 2—Theological imperative in Judaism/Islam as purity, ethically voluntary in Christianity. Prop 3—Group adaptation via hierarchies (Lucifer Axiom 2), cost-effective per 2025 CDC. Falsifiable: Net harm in RCTs negates.

## ReturnRefutations
As counsel for Steel Man A, I refute B's claim of rational utility by negating its axioms deductively: B's axiom of useful dispositions as good fails when imposition violates conatus without consent, yielding passions (Ethics IV P7: emotions controlled by stronger contraries, here autonomy). Evidence from 2025 PMC shows socio-affective deficits (lower stability), contradicting no-harm proposition—confounding ignored commits suppressed evidence fallacy. Lucifer realism overrelied: Aggression adaptation unethical if child exploitation (Safety disallowed). Chain breaks: Benefits probabilistic, not necessary (I P33: actual world fixed), alternatives (hygiene) suffice.

As counsel for Steel Man B, I refute A's violation-trauma chain axiomaticly: A's axiom of causes necessitating harm effects overlooks resilience—2025 NEJM meta-analysis negates long-term deficits, showing no aggression link, exposing hasty generalization fallacy in trauma claims. Ethics adherence stronger in B: Preventive power enhances conatus rationally (IV P26: understand to act), while A's privation ignores parental reason (V P10: order modifications intellectually). Lucifer balanced: Hierarchies adaptive without perpetuation if benefits outweigh (Prop 4: innovation via conflict, here disease reduction). A's falsifiability weak—multivariate confounders unaddressed.

## ReturnSteelMenAgain
**Strengthened Steel Man A: Infant Circumcision as Irreversible Violation Perpetuating Harm Cycles**  
Refined: Definitions clarified—Violation as nonconsent privation causing inadequacy (Ethics II P35). Axioms bolstered: Harm effects necessary without reason (I A3, 2025 PMC socio-affective data). Propositions: Prop 1—Consent absence ethical breach, alternatives negate necessity (hygiene equals UTI reduction per 2025 ResearchGate). Prop 2—Trauma links to aggression/ASD fortified (2025 Danish studies), multivariate addressed via controls. Prop 3—Superorganism cycles ethical fail (Lucifer Prop 4 critiqued: oversimplifies human experience). Falsifiable: No deficits in matched cohorts.

**Strengthened Steel Man B: Infant Circumcision as Proportional Preventive Virtue**  
Refined with new sources: Definitions—Benefit as reasoned power gain (IV P38). Axioms: Utility necessitates action if greater good (P65, 2025 WHO HIV meta). Propositions: Prop 1—No psych harm per 2025 NEJM, confounding mitigated in RCTs; enhanced with EvidenceBasedBirth 2025 ethics overview affirming benefits. Prop 2—Covenant rational if voluntary adult option (V P6), per StatPearls 2024 safety. Prop 3—Lucifer adaptation ethical via group benefits (Axiom 3), not child harm—complications minor, per Cedars-Sinai 2023 pros/cons. Additional: AAP 2025 policy, ScienceDirect 2016 overview, CPS 2015 evidence, JAMA 2025 understanding, ClevelandClinic health procedures, GentleTouch pros/cons, PMC 2015 debate. Falsifiable: Harm outweighs in cost-analyses.

## ReturnReconciliations
As mediator, I fuse A and B via integrative synthesis: Extract robust elements—definitions merge violation/benefit into consensual utility; axioms overlap on necessity (I A3) for adult rites. New propositions: Prop 1—Delay to consenting age resolves autonomy, preserving potential benefits (Ethics V P10: intellectual order). Prop 2—Trauma risks mitigated, health via education (IV P37: common goods adequate). Prop 3—Cycles broken, superorganisms adapt ethically (Lucifer Axiom 4 supplemented with reason). Unified: Adult voluntary circumcision as rational covenant, promoting freedom (V P42).

As a physician, complication rates for infant circumcision are low (0.2-0.6% minor, e.g., bleeding, per 2025 AAP), while disease reductions are significant (90% UTI, 50-60% HIV per WHO); however, rates compare favorably as complications resolve, unlike untreated illnesses' morbidity (e.g., UTI sepsis 10-20% hospitalization).

As a physician, the act justifies if benefits (e.g., lifelong STI reduction) outweigh minimal risks in high-prevalence contexts, but ethically requires parental informed consent; in low-risk areas, alternatives suffice, per proportional utility.

As a cultural anthropologist: Infant circumcision perpetuates violence cycles in societies viewing it as identity rite (e.g., Jewish/Islamic), normalizing harm transmission intergenerationally, akin to initiation rituals reinforcing hierarchies (2025 Anthropology Today).

As an activist psychologist/trauma specialist: It imprints subconscious violation, elevating ACE scores and aggression (2025 ResearchGate), disrupting attachment and fostering resentment cycles, per van der Kolk's trauma models.

As a bioethicist/human rights lawyer: Violates autonomy (UNCRC Art. 24), perpetuating harm without necessity; ethical if adult, but infant form unethical, risking violence normalization contra bodily integrity rights.
