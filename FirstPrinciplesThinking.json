  "method": "First Principles Thinking",
  "origin": "Popularized by Elon Musk, drawing from physics and Aristotelian philosophy, where problems are reduced to their most basic elements before rebuilding solutions.",
  "core_principle": "Boil things down to the most fundamental truths you can imagine and then reason up from there. This contrasts with reasoning by analogy, which Musk argues limits innovation by copying existing solutions without questioning underlying assumptions.",
  "description": "First principles thinking is a systematic approach to problem-solving that emphasizes deconstruction and reconstruction based on irrefutable facts. It's used in engineering, business, and innovation to achieve breakthroughs by avoiding conventional wisdom and focusing on what is physically or logically possible. Musk has applied this at SpaceX (e.g., rethinking rocket costs from raw materials), Tesla (e.g., battery design from atomic levels), and xAI (e.g., training AI to derive answers independently).",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_number": 1,
      "title": "Identify and Define the Problem Clearly",
      "details": "Start by articulating the exact problem or goal. Avoid vague statements; make it specific and measurable.",
      "notes": [
        "This step prevents working on the wrong issue. For example, instead of 'build a better car,' define it as 'create an affordable electric vehicle with a 300-mile range.'",
        "Question assumptions: Why does the problem exist? What are the constraints (real vs. perceived)?",
        "Tip: Write it down to crystallize thoughts. Musk often stresses clarity to avoid downstream errors."
      ]
    },
    {
      "step_number": 2,
      "title": "Break Down the Problem into Fundamental Truths",
      "details": "Deconstruct the problem into its basic components or 'first principles' – the most elementary facts that are undeniably true, often rooted in physics, logic, or empirical evidence.",
      "notes": [
        "These are things that cannot be broken down further, like laws of nature (e.g., energy conservation) or basic costs (e.g., price of raw materials like lithium for batteries).",
        "Avoid analogies: Don't say 'it's like how airplanes work'; instead, ask 'What are the physics of flight?'",
        "Common pitfalls: Relying on industry standards or 'that's how it's always done.' Musk critiques this as 'reasoning by analogy,' which copies flaws.",
        "Example from Musk: For rockets, don't assume high costs; calculate from raw materials (aluminum, carbon fiber) and ask why assembly is expensive.",
        "Note: This step requires research or knowledge in foundational sciences. If unsure, consult physics textbooks or basic data."
      ]
    },
    {
      "step_number": 3,
      "title": "Question Every Assumption",
      "details": "Challenge all preconceived notions about the problem. Ask 'Why?' repeatedly (like the '5 Whys' technique) until you reach bedrock truths.",
      "notes": [
        "This is iterative; keep digging until you hit something indisputable.",
        "Musk's advice: 'Assume that what you think you know is wrong, and verify.' This fosters skepticism toward experts or historical precedents.",
        "In practice: For electric cars, question why batteries are expensive – is it materials, manufacturing, or supply chain? Break it to atoms if needed.",
        "Psychological note: This combats cognitive biases like status quo bias or anchoring.",
        "Tip: Use mind maps or lists to document assumptions and their validations."

        "Build upward: Combine basics into novel configurations. For instance, at Tesla, start from electron flow in batteries and design optimized cells.",
        "Incorporate iteration: Test prototypes, gather data, refine. Musk emphasizes rapid iteration at SpaceX (e.g., Starship explosions as learning).",
        "Avoid overcomplication: Focus on simplicity; if a part isn't necessary based on first principles, remove it.",
        "Creative aspect: This is where innovation happens – e.g., Musk's Hyperloop from vacuum physics and maglev basics.",
